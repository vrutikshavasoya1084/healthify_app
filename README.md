## üìå Introduction 
Healthify is a cross-platform application that can be used in Android and it is made using Flutter. It aims to solve the mental health issues of a person. The app includes everything you need in a single place so that you don‚Äôt have to use multiple apps to carry out tasks like monitoring health . It is a single app that has two dashboards for the User and Doctor.

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## üì¶ API Used 
- [Nutritionix API](https://www.nutritionix.com/)

## üèÉ‚ÄçÔ∏è Getting Started

- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and be running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## üìã Prerequisites

-  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), with a recent version of the Android SDK.

## üìù Why this Project?
The lockdown has rendered us almost immobile and stuck to a chair. The mental health of the population, rich and poor alike has hit pathetic lows during this unforeseen pandemic. It is noticed that people turn out to be more anxious and stressed when confined to the four walls of their houses. It has been experienced that people working from home miss out on basic stuff like drinking water and having nutritious food. To take some time off the screen, and to be physically as well as mentally fit, yoga is proven to be a very good choice. So to solve these issues we came up with the idea of healthify. We focused on building some useful trackers, such as Food, Water, Body Measurement, and also building a platform to consult with a doctor regarding any mental health/any other health issues so that the seeker can get the help they need without being judged as the app includes a feature to be anonymous while seeking help from a doctor. Human beings being social creatures have lost all the chances of being social these days, which also brings up issues like loneliness and depression. People who are working from home and the students face a lot of stress due to the deadlines and obviously, people need a break. Since people are forced to stay inside the house, people also find it difficult to get help from doctors as going to hospitals is riskier as they get exposed to a hostile environment, and having more patients in the hospitals makes the situation worse. 
    
## üèÉ‚ÄçÔ∏è How we came to solve this problem?
Taking all these concerns into account, most people prefer to have some sort of support for their mental wellbeing. This is where the idea of Healthify (a mental-health monitoring/help provider app) comes into play. In society, especially in India, usually, mental health issues are either ignored or at times laughed at due to society‚Äôs judgemental mindset about mental health problems. Having an application where you can get the solutions to all of your problems and open up without the fear of being misjudged by society is our prime aim. It‚Äôs not just mental health, we also focus on the physical health of a person as physical health also plays a major role in the quality of mental health. So, we have also included nutrition monitoring features in the app. Usually, when a person is down, they ignore their nutrition balance and healthy diet. The app includes some meditation and exercise suggestions based on the trend of the user activity features as these come as a handy tool when it comes to mental health solutions. 
Using an app as a common platform to treat patients will also be helpful for a doctor as everything will be just a click away. They don‚Äôt have to get in physical contact with people as if not careful, doctors or the patients can act as carriers for certain diseases. Hence, contacting patients over an app solves the majority of the problems while remaining safe.
